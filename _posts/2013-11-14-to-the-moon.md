 To keep better track of my life and get thoughts from my head into a more concreate form, I'm starting a diary. I don't expect much from this so it'll will probably start out as 80% links to interesting things or helpful reminders of things to look at. But the other time I'll be posting about my life, what I've been working on, and what I'm enjoying or dispising at the moment.

 As a first entry, I've been working on a reverse color scheme for a minimalist javascript game called **A Dark Room**. The game can be found [here](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/), and the source [here](https://github.com/Continuities/adarkroom). The game is an extremely intriging story and a perfect example of *great graphics aren't nessessary for an amazing experience*. I encourage anyone to try the game. While it is not natively mobile friendly, there is an app in the Apple App Store.

 Checkout the new *lights off* feature and let me know what you think.
